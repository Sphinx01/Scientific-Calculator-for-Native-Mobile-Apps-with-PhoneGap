# Scientific-Calculator-for-Native-Mobile-Apps-with-PhoneGap
This is a scientific calculator written in HTML5 and JavaScript. I used PhoneGap framework to package the app in the native mobile platforms. The app can be run in browsers but to run it your emulator or smartphone. You need an SDK and phoneGap installed on your computer.
